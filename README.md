### What am I up to?
- 🌊 I’m currently working on updating the Ocean Health Index calculations as part of the OHI Fellowship at @[NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/)
- 🌱  I recently graduated from a Master of Environmental Data Science program, which culminated in a Capstone Project: Identifying Priority Survey Sites for Early-Season Milkweed Conservation [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/MEDS-SBBG-milkweed)  | [Bren Page](https://bren.ucsb.edu/projects/identifying-priority-survey-sites-early-season-milkweed-conservation)  |   [Technical Documentation](https://bren.ucsb.edu/media/5411)
    - As the Data Manager on this project, I worked to create a [Dryad Archive](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.2rbnzs7x4) (DOI 10.5061) of our data products and in-depth data documentation.

This is one of those funny GitHub vs real life mismatch moments. Well over 50% of my work has been in R, which has largely been in .Rmd (R Markdown) and .Qmd (Quarto Markdown) documents.
